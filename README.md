## About the feature:

### 1. Text Detection with Optical Character Recognition (OCR):

* Utilizes Google Vision's OCR capabilities to accurately recognize text within images.
* Supports various image formats and handles diverse font styles and orientations.

### 2. Seamless Integration with Python Libraries:

* Employs user-friendly Python libraries to facilitate interaction with the Google Vision API.
* Simplifies the process of sending image data and retrieving extracted text.

### 3. Potential Applications:

* Automating data entry from scanned documents like receipts and invoices.
* Simplifying image caption generation for visually impaired users.
* Building content moderation tools for filtering inappropriate text within images.

## üìã Key Features
‚ö°Ô∏è **Dashboard**: Get a comprehensive overview of your extract images and counts in one centralized dashboard.\
‚ö°Ô∏è **Drag and Drop**: Effortlessly extract images with simple steps, with easy select and drag and drop feature to select.\
‚ö°Ô∏è **Extract Image**: Quickly extract images text info with just single click and after that view it from there only.\
‚ö°Ô∏è **Profile**: Organize and access user informated are provided on the user .\
‚ö°Ô∏è **Login and Logout**: login and logout functionality for security and isolated work.
